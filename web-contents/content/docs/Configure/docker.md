### Docker Deployment

---

### Running with `docker run`

You can start the Fleare service using the `docker run` command while passing a YAML configuration as an environment variable.

### Command:

```bash 
docker run -p 9219:9219 --name fleare_service --restart unless-stopped extendsware/fleare:latest
```

### Command with config:

```bash 
docker run -e "config=$(cat config.yaml)" -p 9219:9219 --name fleare_service --restart unless-stopped extendsware/fleare:latest
```

### Explanation:

*   `-e "config=$(cat config.yaml)"`: Reads the contents of `config.yaml` and passes it as an environment variable.

*   `-p 9219:9219`: Maps port 9219 from the container to the host.

*   `--name fleare_service`: Assigns a name to the running container.

*   `--restart unless-stopped`: Ensures the container restarts unless manually stopped.

*   `extendsware/fleare:latest`: Uses the latest version of the Fleare image.

### Running Fleare with Docker Compose

You can use `docker-compose` to define and manage the Fleare service.

### `docker-compose.yml` Example:

```yaml 
version: '3.8'

services:
  fleare:
    image: extendsware/fleare:latest
    container_name: fleare_service
    ports:
      - "9219:9219"  # Adjust as needed
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      config: |
        security:
          enable_auth: true
          auth_method: "basic"
          users:
            - username: "root"
              password: "root"
              role: "root"
```

### Output

 

### Explanation:

*   **`version: '3.8'`**: Specifies the Docker Compose file format version.

*   **`services`**: Defines containerized services.

*   **`fleare`**: Name of the service.

*   **`image: extendsware/fleare:latest`**: Uses the latest Fleare image.

*   **`container_name: fleare_service`**: Assigns a fixed name to the container.

*   **`ports`**: Maps container ports to host ports.

*   **`restart: unless-stopped`**: Ensures the container restarts unless manually stopped.

*   **`environment`**: Defines environment variables for the container.
              \- The `config` variable contains YAML-style authentication settings:
                \- Enables authentication.
                \- Uses `basic` authentication.
                \- Defines users with usernames and passwords.

### Deploying with Docker Compose

To deploy using Docker Compose, run:

```bash 
docker-compose up -d
```

### Stopping the Service

```bash 
docker-compose down
```

### Verifying the Deployment

After deployment, verify the service is running with:

```bash 
docker ps
```

Check logs:

```bash 
docker logs fleare_service
```

This setup ensures a secure and manageable Fleare deployment using Docker.
