### Database Installation Manual 

---

`(arm64 and amd64)`

Here's a **User Installation Manual** document for the provided `fleare` installation script.

(`Apple Silicon`) and (`amd64`)

### Overview

This manual will guide you through the installation and initial setup of the `Fleare` database on macOS using the provided Bash installation script.

---

### System Requirements

* **Operating System**: macOS arm64 (required)
* **Privileges**: Root/admin privileges (for directory creation and file placement)
* **Binary**: Ensure the compiled `fleare` binary is present in the same directory as the script

---

#### Download the installation file and extract zip file

 * Download (`Apple Silicon`) file üëâ [fleare-1-0-1-darwin-arm64.tar.gz](https://www.bakemyweb.com/files/public/32/15/67b778664b7fb7001ed53215/d/8f/91/67ceaafd015b80001e818f91?name=infleare-1-0-1-darwin-arm64.tar.gz&mimetype=application/x-gzip&cd=attachment)

 * Download (`amd64`) file üëâ [fleare-1-0-1-darwin-amd64.tar.gz](https://www.bakemyweb.com/files/public/32/15/67b778664b7fb7001ed53215/d/8f/91/67ceaafd015b80001e818f91?name=infleare-1-0-1-darwin-amd64.tar.gz&mimetype=application/x-gzip&cd=attachment)


 1. Unzip the Installation zip file (`fleare-1-0-1-darwin-arm64.tar.gz`)
 2. Ensure the script has execution permissions.
 3. Read `README.md` for installation guide.

---

### Installation Steps

#### 1. **Prepare the Environment**

Before running the script, ensure:

* The script file is saved, e.g., `install.sh`
* The `fleare` binary file is compiled and available in the same directory

```bash 
ls
# Output should include:
# install.sh  fleare
```

---

#### 2. **Run the Installer**

Make the script executable:

```bash 
chmod +x install.sh
```

Then run the script using `sudo` to allow system modifications:

```bash 
sudo ./install.sh
```

---

#### 3. **Script Actions Explained**

The script will:

* **Verify Operating System**: Checks if the OS is macOS
* **Create Directories**:

  * Configuration: `/etc/fleare`
  * Logs: `/usr/local/fleare/log`
  * Data: `/usr/local/fleare/db`
  * Backups: `/usr/local/fleare/backups`
* **Copy Binary**: Installs the `fleare` binary to `/usr/local/bin/fleare` and makes it executable
* **Generate Default Configuration**: Creates `config.yaml` with standard settings at `/etc/fleare/config.yaml`

---

### Configuration File

**Path**: `/etc/fleare/config.yaml`

This file controls all runtime behavior. Default sections include:

* **Server Settings**
* **Logging**
* **Memory Limits & Policies**
* **Security & Authentication**
* **Persistence Settings**
* **Sharding Configuration**
* **Backup Scheduling**
* **Miscellaneous Options**

 **Tip**: Modify the configuration file to suit your deployment requirements before running the server.

---

### Verification

After installation:

```bash 
which fleare
# Should return: /usr/local/bin/fleare

cat /etc/fleare/config.yaml
# Should display the configuration file
```

---

### Starting the Application

Once installed, run:

```bash 
fleare
```

Monitor the logs:

```bash 
tail -f /usr/local/fleare/log/fleareDB.log
```

---

### Default Credentials

* **Username**: `root`
* **Password**: `root`
  ‚ö†Ô∏è *Change this in production environments.*

---

### Backup & Persistence

* **Backups**: Enabled every 60 minutes
* **Persistence**: Data saved to `/usr/local/fleare/db` after every 100 writes

---

### Uninstallation (Manual)

To remove all installed files:

```bash 
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/fleare
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/fleare
sudo rm -rf /etc/fleare
```
